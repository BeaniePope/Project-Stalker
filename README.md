# Project-Stalker 

Arma 3 STALKER project for my Arma Server

Hey! This code is not made to be built, I'm using github to cloud store the scripting files for various systems within the game to make my life easier down the line

EDIT: This code now contains all files required to build the STALKER ZEUS Scenario

There are many required mods for this to all run properly within Arma, and if you stumble upon this project be wary that unless I have published a collection that I will list below
many of the trigger scripts or the reputation script will not work

The intent is that all this will come together with the power of zeus to give a framework for a semi-persistent STALKER experience, Zeus doing heavy lifting, and visual storytelling taking precedent

This project could be abandoned at any point, but until then or even after, if there are any questions about Arma scripting or my shitty code, you can DM me at any time at BeaniePope#9090 on discord!

If you're from my Arma server and are hoping I'm actually developing this, I am! Probably. Can't predict the future, but you get the point. You know how to reach me, and I'll be honest
